# ROBOT HOME / PARKING SPOTS
# ================================================================
# Each robot has a designated "home spot" — its initial position in
# the factory floor. After completing a delivery, robots return here
# instead of parking at the workstation, which prevents goal-blocking:
#
#   ❌ BEFORE: Robot 1 sits at WS2 → blocks Robot 2 trying to deliver
#              another task to WS2 → DEADLOCK on the workstation lane.
#   ✅ AFTER:  Robot 1 returns to (-7, 3) (its home spot) → WS2 is free
#              for any robot that needs it next.
#
# These coordinates EXACTLY mirror the ROBOT_N translation values in
# worlds/smart_factory.wbt. Each spot is in a quiet area of the
# corridor mesh (y=±3), well away from workstation/storage approach
# points (y=±3.5, ±1.5).
PARKING_SPOTS = {
    # Initial home spots — used at sim startup only. After completing
    # tasks, robots use task chaining + lazy relocation (see REST_NODES)
    # rather than always returning home.

# REST_NODES — corridor / aisle nodes where IDLE robots park
# while waiting for the next task.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Used by lazy relocation: after finishing a delivery, a robot
# goes IDLE in place, then if no new task arrives within ~1s it
# relocates to the NEAREST rest node (not its original home).
# This dramatically reduces empty travel and keeps robots distributed
# across the factory floor — much more efficient than every robot
# returning to its assigned home spot.

#     just outside the shelf (e.g. (-2.25, -1.75) or (-2, -1.5)) remain
#     in free space and the planner can still curve around shelf corners.
#   • No ROBOT_RADIUS inflation (unlike physical obstacles) because the
