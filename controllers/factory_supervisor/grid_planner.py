"""
Grid-based Path Planner for Factory Floor
==========================================

Replaces the old corridor graph (38 hand-placed nodes + 45 edges) with a
fine-grained occupancy grid that lets robots traverse the entire free
space — diagonals, around shelves, through gaps — without being limited
to north/south/middle corridors.

Architecture
------------
Factory: 18m × 11m (x ∈ [-9, 9], y ∈ [-5.5, 5.5])
Resolution: 0.25 m/cell (chosen so robot footprint = 1.4 cells diameter
            and shelves take ≥2 cells of obstacle padding)
Grid: 72 cols × 44 rows = 3168 cells

Each cell is labeled:
  FREE         — robot can occupy
  OBSTACLE     — physical object (shelf, table, factory boundary)
  INFLATED     — within ROBOT_RADIUS of an obstacle (forbidden)
  AVOID_ZONE   — inside a workstation/storage/charging zone (cost penalty
                 but not blocked — allows approach to docks)

The grid is built ONCE at startup from config.OBSTACLE_BOXES + dock zones,
then used by GridAStar for any-to-any path queries.

Key features
------------
* 8-connectivity (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) with √2 diagonal cost
* Octile heuristic (admissible & consistent for 8-conn grids)
* Theta*-style line-of-sight smoothing post-processing (reduces zigzag)
* Path waypoint subsampling (every 1.5m, for time-step granularity)
* Obstacle inflation by ROBOT_RADIUS + SAFETY_MARGIN
